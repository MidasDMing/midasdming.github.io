I am now a lecturer in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology, and leading the <b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NQRaX1oAAAAJ&hl=en">Machine Intelligence and Large-scale Optimization (MILO)</a></b> Research Group.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <b><a href="https://www.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a></b> under the supervision of <b><a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/197">Prof. Chris H.Q. Ding</a></b> in May 2020.
Before that, I received my master in Computer Science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China under the supervision of <b><a href="https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wenquan/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Quan Wen</a></b> in June 2014, and received my bachelor in Computer Science from Sichuan Agricultural University in June 2011.

My primary research interests are machine learning and optimization, aiming at developing robust learning models and efficient optimization algorithms to solve real-world problems in various scenarios, such as feature selection, data reconstruction, subspace clustering, representation learning, graph learning, adversarial attack, foreground extraction, saliency detection, dermoscopy image segmentation, etc.

<b>Office</b>: Room B208, First Laboratory Building, 69 Hongguang Avenue, Banan District, Chongqing 400054.
