I am now a lecturer in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology, and leading the <b><a href="https://midasdming.github.io/milo-group/">Machine Intelligence and Large-scale Optimization Group (MILO-Group)</a></b>.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <b><a href="https://www.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington (UT Arlington)</a></b> under the supervision of <b><a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/197">Prof. Chris H.Q. Ding</a></b> in May 2020. Before that, I received my master degree in Computer Science from <b><a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a></b> under the supervision of <b><a href="https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wenquan/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Quan Wen</a></b> in June 2014, and received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from <b><a href="https://english.sicau.edu.cn/">Sichuan Agricultural University (SICAU)</a></b> in June 2011.

My primary research interests are machine learning and optimization, aiming at developing robust learning models and efficient optimization algorithms to solve real-world problems in various scenarios, such as feature selection, data reconstruction, subspace clustering, representation learning, graph learning, adversarial attack, foreground extraction, saliency detection, dermoscopy image segmentation, etc.

<b>Office</b>: Room B208, First Laboratory Building, 69 Hongguang Avenue, Banan District, Chongqing 400054.
