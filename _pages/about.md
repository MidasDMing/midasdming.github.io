I am now a lecturer in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology, and leading the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NQRaX1oAAAAJ&hl=en">Machine Intelligence and Large-Scale Optimization (MILO@CQUT)</a> Research Group.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.uta.edu/">University of Texas at Arlington</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/197">Prof. Chris Ding</a> in May 2020.
Before that, I received my master in Computer Science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wenquan/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Quan Wen</a> in Jun 2014, and received my bachelor in Computer Science from Sichuan Agricultural University in Jun 2011.

My primary research interests are machine Learning, optimization and data mining, aiming at developing robust and flexible learning models to solve real-world problems in various scenarios, such as feature selection, data reconstruction, subspace clustering, representation learning, adversarial attack, foreground object extraction, dermoscopy image segmentation, etc.
